## Workflow

* Develop and Test locally on your own machine
* Push  code to a development, feature or issue branch. Create pull request.
* I will test and give feedback
* If code is OK I will merge with the 7.x branch.
* Branches should be named 7.x-yourname-branchname

Branch naming examples:
```
7.x-jur-dev
```
```
7.x-jur-issue_777789

* [jQuery Update](https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update) - Set to load 2.1 on frontend pages and 1.8 on seven theme)

### Installing

Installs like any other theme. Recommended: install glazed_helper (Glazed Theme Tools) module.

```
drush en glazed_builder -y
```

To enable the module on a field, set Glazed Builder formatter on any entity textfield. For example on Basic Page body field (example.com/admin/structure/types/manage/page/display). The builder should show when viewing a node of this type (not on de node/add or node/edit form).

### Developing

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used to parse sass to CSS and combine JS files. Don't run npm install, development modules are included.

```
grunt
```
